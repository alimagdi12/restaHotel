It is exactly located at the intersection of suez canal with the Mediterranean Sea. It is very nice to see the view of both suez canal and the sea from your room balcony.\r\nThe staff are friendly and professional.\r\nThey upgraded our room to suite for free and without request from our side.\r\nI recommend this hotel in Portsaid.","name":"Akram","job":"Egypt","image":""},{"opinion":"We checked in to the hotel and were upgraded by Mr Ehab the hotel manager to a suite on the third floor with a large balcony directly overlooking the entrance to the Suez Canal Stunning views from this balcony and the bedroom window of all the ships entering or leaving the canal - including the arrival of a luxury cruise ship moored directly below the hotel. Separate living room and bedroom were very comfortable and well-equipped and room service was prompt and efficient. Excellent buffet breakfast in restaurant and friendly and helpful service at reception and throughout hotel. Our only problem was that we were staying for only one night. Thanks to the management and staff for making our stay so memorable.","name":"Zeinab","job":"United Kingdom","image":""}]
